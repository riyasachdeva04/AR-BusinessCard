This application utilizes Unity SDK, Vuforia Search Engine, and ReadyMe Player Avatar to create an interactive and immersive Augmented Reality (AR) experience for sharing your business information. The virtual UI buttons enable users to open URLs with a simple click, providing an innovative and engaging way to connect with your online presence.

## Introduction
In this AR Business Card, you can showcase your professional identity in a unique and interactive manner. By using Unity SDK, Vuforia Search Engine, and ReadyMe Player Avatar, users can experience an AR representation of you or your brand, which includes an animated avatar and clickable virtual buttons to navigate to relevant URLs.


## Features
AR Experience: Create an immersive AR experience that presents your business card in an interactive way.
ReadyMe Player Avatar: Add a lifelike animated avatar that represents you or your brand.
Vuforia Search Engine: Utilize Vuforia's powerful image recognition capabilities for marker-based AR tracking.
Virtual UI Buttons: Implement virtual buttons that, when clicked, open URLs to your website, portfolio, social media, and more.
Customizable Design: Personalize the appearance and content of your AR business card to match your branding.


## How It Works
The AR Business Card application uses the Vuforia SDK to recognize image targets or markers in the real world. Once the marker is detected, the ReadyMe Player Avatar is placed in the AR scene and begins its animation. The virtual UI buttons are positioned in the scene and linked to scripts that handle URL opening on click.

The interaction with the virtual buttons triggers an event, which then opens the respective URLs using the device's default web browser. You can customize the URLs and button appearances to fit your specific requirements.
